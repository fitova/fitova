# Project Overview: Fitova

**Tagline:** Your smart fashion hub

## Project Idea
Fitova is an advanced affiliate fashion platform that aggregates products from multiple brands while offering a unique, intelligent shopping experience. Users can quickly find everything they want, filter products dynamically, and enjoy a stylish, modern interface.

## Target Audience
All ages, both men and women, interested in fashion and smart shopping.

## Core Features
- **Dynamic UI:** The website interface changes based on the filters and style choices selected by the user. Layered UI allows combining multiple contexts, e.g., Winter + Casual, Winter + Another Style, etc.
- **Save Worlds:** Users can save full outfits or filter sets, not just individual products.
- **AI Styling:** Suggest complete outfits based on uploaded images or user preferences.
- **Collections / Lookbooks:** Complete outfits grouped for easy browsing.
- **Offers & Coupons:** Centralized management of discounts and promotions.
- **Dashboard:** Full control over products, filters, collections, offers, and user interactions.
- **Affiliate Integration:** Connect with external affiliate APIs (SHEIN, Amazon, etc.) to pull products automatically.

## Goals
1. Launch a fully functional website first, with all core features integrated.
2. Expand to a mobile app later, reusing website data and AI functionalities.
3. Provide a seamless, enjoyable shopping experience with intuitive filters and layered UI styling.
4. Make administration and content management simple via a centralized dashboard.
